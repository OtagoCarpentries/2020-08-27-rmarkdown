# Introduction to RMarkdown

This workshop will introduce markdown which is a syntax for encoding formatting from which documents can be made in multiple output formats from a single source document.

R Markdown is a tool for writing reproducible reports, document and presentations by combining markdown and R code.


By attending this workshop, learners can expect to come away understanding:

- The syntax of markdown for common formatting tasks
- How to create and compile an RMarkdown document
